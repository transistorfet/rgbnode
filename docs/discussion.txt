- the RGB engine, as well as the comm protocol (which is less important)
  should support certain functions (which I will discuss below)

- I've had minor questions in my head about the importance and value of having
  seperate controllers with seperately controlled lights.  You'll probably want
  the RGB strips to behave the same more often than you will want them different.
  With singular changes, that will be very easy, but animated changes will be
  harder (but not impossible).  To that end, sync messages could be sent; a
  'fade to colour' message sent each time the master completes its last fade
  (for the swirl animation).  That whole brownian motion animation idea will be
  harder though and will likely require constant comm traffic.


POSSIBLE/NEEDED ENGINE STATE CHANGIE THINGS:
- set colour, stop
- strobe colour
- fade colour
(damn this makes no sense, I should wait until I get home to do this).


POSSIBLE/NEEDED COMM MESSAGES:
- change colour
- change mode??
- change colour after time delay
- fade to colour over time delay
